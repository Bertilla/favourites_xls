favourites_xls
==============

A script to download all your favourited tweets to an excel spreadsheet. You will need to:

1. Get Python (if you don't already have it) - Please download a version as appropriate for your OS - http://www.python.org/getit/
2. Download this script and run it by doing "python favourites_xls.py" from the command line. It will generate a twitter_favourites.xls in the same folder. 
3. Um...not that I'm an XBox One fan but be online when you run the script.
